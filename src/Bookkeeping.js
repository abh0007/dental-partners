      <h2>Bookkeeping & Accounting Services</h2>
      <p>As a dentist, you do not have the bandwidth to keep up with accounting on a daily basis. You probably are using QuickBooks or accounting software that captures your transactions. You are following a cash-based accounting model that will not truly reflect the value of the practice when you plan to sell your practice as it does not account for future cash flows. We will help you move to accrual-based accounting and keep your records straight.

We will either use the accounting software that you currently have or give you free software to manage your accounts. We will sign your practice for a free accounting software account, link your bank account to the software, create charts of accounts, categorize the transactions & finally submit reports on a monthly basis.

Detailed Service Info:

Transitioning from cash-based accounting to accrual-based accounting is crucial for dentists who plan to sell their practice in the future. While cash-based accounting records transactions as they occur, accrual-based accounting provides a more comprehensive view by recognizing revenue and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the actual cash exchange takes place. By adopting accrual-based accounting, you can accurately represent the financial health and potential of your practice to potential buyers.
